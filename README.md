# HumanResource
Simple and basic start of an HR software package.  This handles the view of an employee record.  Functionality, previous record, next record, 
create record, and delete record.  This is not a polished program yet, with all error checking of data types, etc.  But the major parts
and concepts are there.  This uses a MySQL data base, and the database schema has been uploaded if you would like to create
a table and test it out.
